# Additional Team Rules

## ESLint Error Handling

Limit fix attempts to avoid time waste:
- Try fixing once
- If still problematic, stop further attempts

## Rule Synchronization

When syncing between cursorrules (.mdc) and claude.md:
- Direct content transfer only, no analysis/modifications
- Watch for encoding differences between .mdc and .md formats to avoid corruption
- Specifically avoid emoji symbols (such as ✅ ❌ etc.) - use text alternatives like "Good:" "Bad:" instead
- These rules guide Cursor and Claude Code for collaborative coding

## Code Optimization Guidelines

### Tailwind CSS Classes

DO NOT extract Tailwind utility classes to constants as "magic numbers":
- Classes like `w-12`, `h-8`, `text-sm`, `p-4` should stay inline
- These are design tokens, not magic numbers
- Extracting them is over-engineering and reduces readability
- Keep Tailwind classes where they are used for better maintainability
